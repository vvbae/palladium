A toy high-level programming language intended to be run on the Iridium VM (https://github.com/vvbae/iridium). 

In terms of syntax, it mimics Python as much as possible. 
In terms of functionality, it mimics Erlang as much as possible.

Inspired by [building-language-vm]("https://blog.subnetzero.io/post/building-language-vm-part-20/")
